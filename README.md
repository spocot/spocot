A bit about me
- 🏢 Currently working as a Software Engineer at Citizens Bank.
- 🖥️ Fascinated with OS development and programming language design.
- 🍲 Cooking, 🥾 Hiking, and 🎮 Gaming are some of the things I enjoy in my spare time (when I'm not busy with a new programming language)

## New England 🦞

Right now I live in Johnston, Rhode Island but I've been kicking it around the Northeast for my entire life.
Send me or ask me for recommendations for food and things to do!
